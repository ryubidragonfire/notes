- type of artificial intelligence algorithms used in unsupervised machine learning, implemented by a system of two neural networks competing against each other in a zero-sum game framework.

    -  a generative model is a model for randomly generating observable data values, typically given some hidden parameters. It specifies a joint probability distribution over observation and label sequences. Generative models are used in machine learning for either modeling data directly (i.e., modeling observations drawn from a probability density function), or as an intermediate step to forming a conditional probability density function. A conditional distribution can be formed from a generative model through Bayes' rule.

    - also called conditional models, are a class of models used in machine learning for modeling the dependence of an unobserved variable {\displaystyle y} y on an observed variable {\displaystyle x} x. Within a probabilistic framework, this is done by modeling the conditional probability distribution {\displaystyle P(y|x)} P(y|x), which can be used for predicting {\displaystyle y} y from {\displaystyle x} x.
Discriminative models, as opposed to generative models, do not allow one to generate samples from the joint distribution of {\displaystyle x} x and {\displaystyle y} y.
